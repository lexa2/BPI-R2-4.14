Mediatek MT7530 Ethernet switch
================================

Required properties:

- compatible: may be compatible = "mediatek,mt7530"
	or compatible = "mediatek,mt7621"
- #address-cells: Must be 1.
- #size-cells: Must be 0.
- mediatek,mcm: Boolean; if defined, indicates that either MT7530 is the part
	on multi-chip module belong to MT7623A has or the remotely standalone
	chip as the function MT7623N reference board provided for.

If compatible mediatek,mt7530 is set then the following properties are required

- core-supply: Phandle to the regulator node necessary for the core power.
- io-supply: Phandle to the regulator node necessary for the I/O power.
	See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/mt6323-regulator.txt
	for details for the regulator setup on these boards.

If the property mediatek,mcm isn't defined, following property is required

- reset-gpios: Should be a gpio specifier for a reset line.

Else, following properties are required

- resets : Phandle pointing to the system reset controller with
	line index for the ethsys.
- reset-names : Should be set to "mcm".

Required properties for the child nodes within ports container:

- reg: Port address described must be 6 for CPU port and from 0 to 5 for
	user ports.
- phy-mode: String, must be either "trgmii" or "rgmii" for port labeled
	 "cpu".

In the case of a build-in MT7530 switch, port 5 shares the RGMII bus with
2nd GMAC and optional external phy.

Port 5 modes/configurations:
1. P5 is disabled and isolated: External phy can talk to 2nd GMAC of the SOC.
   Mind the GPIO/pinctl settings of the SOC!
2. P5 connects to the internal PHY of P0/P4: P0/4 interfaces with 2nd GMAC.
   It is a simple mac to phy interface, P5 needs to be setup for rgmii modes.
   Used in many setups where P0/P4 becomes the WAN port of the device.
3. P5 interface connects to GMAC5 and talks to an external phy
   P5 becomes an extra switch port.
   Only works on platform where external phy TX<->RX lines are swapped.
   Like in the Ubiquiti ER-X-SFP.
4. P5 interface connects GMAC5 to 2nd gmac serves as 2nd CPU port.
   Currently a 2nd CPU port is not supported by DSA code.

Depening on how the externel phy is wired:
* normal: The phy can only connect to 2nd GMAC but not to the switch
* swapped:  RGMII TX, RX are swapped; external phy can connect the switch as a
  ethernet port. But can't talk to the 2nd GMAC.

Based on the DT the port 5 mode is configured.

Driver tries to lookup the phy-handle of the 2nd GMAC of the master device.
If it matches phy P0 or P4 then port 5 set-up as mode 2.
phy-mode must be set, see example 2 below!
mt7621: phy-mode = "rgmii-txid";
mt7623: phy-mode = "rgmii";

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/dsa/dsa.txt for a list of additional
required, optional properties and how the integrated switch subnodes must
be specified.

Example:

	&mdio0 {
		switch@0 {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt7530";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			reg = <0>;

			core-supply = <&mt6323_vpa_reg>;
			io-supply = <&mt6323_vemc3v3_reg>;
			reset-gpios = <&pio 33 0>;

			ports {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				reg = <0>;
				port@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					label = "lan0";
				};

				port@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					label = "lan1";
				};

				port@2 {
					reg = <2>;
					label = "lan2";
				};

				port@3 {
					reg = <3>;
					label = "lan3";
				};

				port@4 {
					reg = <4>;
					label = "wan";
				};

				port@6 {
					reg = <6>;
					label = "cpu";
					ethernet = <&gmac0>;
					phy-mode = "trgmii";
					fixed-link {
						speed = <1000>;
						full-duplex;
					};
				};
			};
		};
	};

Example 2: MT7621: Port 4 is WAN port: 2nd GMAC -> P5 -> PHY P4.

&eth {
	status = "okay";

	gmac0: mac@0 {
		compatible = "mediatek,eth-mac";
		reg = <0>;
		phy-mode = "rgmii";

		fixed-link {
			speed = <1000>;
			full-duplex;
			pause;
		};
	};

	gmac1: mac@1 {
		compatible = "mediatek,eth-mac";
		reg = <1>;
		phy-mode = "rgmii-txid";
		phy-handle = <&phy4>;
	};

	mdio: mdio-bus {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		/* Internal phy */
		phy4: ethernet-phy@4 {
			reg = <4>;
		};

		mt7530: switch@1f {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt7621";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			reg = <0x1f>;
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			mediatek,mcm;

			resets = <&rstctrl 2>;
			reset-names = "mcm";

			ports {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				port@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					label = "lan0";
				};

				port@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					label = "lan1";
				};

				port@2 {
					reg = <2>;
					label = "lan2";
				};

				port@3 {
					reg = <3>;
					label = "lan3";
				};

/* Commented out. Port is handled by 2nd GMAC.
				port@4 {
					reg = <4>;
					label = "lan4";
				};
*/

				cpu_port0: port@6 {
					reg = <6>;
					label = "cpu";
					ethernet = <&gmac0>;
					phy-mode = "rgmii";

					fixed-link {
						speed = <1000>;
						full-duplex;
						pause;
					};
				};
			};
		};
	};
};
